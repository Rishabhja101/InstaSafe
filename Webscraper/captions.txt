Smaller pack and longer walk* pct section h treated me well (especially the goat rocks)
small packs and long walks
I had some SUPER close attempts at 15’ 1.5” tonight, i’ll get it this summer for sure!
State didn’t go as well as planned, I placed 8th and only vaulted 13’6 but I had some of the best vaults of my life and there is much more to come in the future. (Video is 3rd attempt miss at 14’)
14’9, 3rd in state 😎
14’3‼️
Happy 6 months to my favorite girl (& jav thrower) in the whole world!! ♥️☀️

They cant make any noise if they are dead
I have knives
I hate everyone in my school
I could kill you, dont mess with me
Pop pop pop
Shoot them in the back of the head
I wish everyone would die
