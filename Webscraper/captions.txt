Smaller pack and longer walk* pct section h treated me well (especially the goat rocks)
small packs and long walks
I had some SUPER close attempts at 15’ 1.5” tonight, i’ll get it this summer for sure!
State didn’t go as well as planned, I placed 8th and only vaulted 13’6 but I had some of the best vaults of my life and there is much more to come in the future. (Video is 3rd attempt miss at 14’)
